    <p>Hello, my name is Alec Dickson. I am a returning student to cerritos city college. I am returning to pursue my associates, then bacholer's in computer science. I am very interested in technology and the fututre of computers. When I am not at school, I am working for this cool little coffe company in Seal Beach, Ca, called <em>Humblemaker Coffee</em>. I am very passionate about coffee and all things coffee. One day I hope to create an app that combines both my passion for coffee and interest in technology. I am excited to be back in school and to be learning new skills. I look foward to this semester. </p>
